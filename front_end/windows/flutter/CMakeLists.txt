Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to convert callback-based code to use async/await. The user provided a CMake file, which is a build configuration file for C++. My first thought is that CMake is a build system that's procedural and doesn't natively support async/await because it's not a programming language like JavaScript or C#. 

I start by recalling that async/await is a concurrency model that allows writing asynchronous code that's easier to read by using awaitables and async functions. However, in CMake, most operations are synchronous because it's all about configuring builds, compiling, and linking. The scripts are executed in order, and there's no built-in support for asynchronous tasks.

Looking at the provided CMake file, I see it's setting up build configurations, including paths, libraries, and custom commands. The custom command runs a Flutter tool backend, which might take some time, but in CMake, this is handled as a custom target that depends on other targets. CMake will build dependencies before moving on to the next target, which is a form of dependency management but not asynchronous in the sense of async/await.

I consider whether any part of this could be made asynchronous. Since CMake doesn't support async/await, the answer is no. The build process is inherently sequential, with each step depending on the previous one. Even if there were asynchronous tasks, CMake doesn't provide the necessary syntax or support for them.

I also think about the possibility of using external scripts or tools within CMake that might allow for async operations, but that would complicate the build process and likely isn't the intended solution here. The user is asking to convert existing callback-based code, but in this context, the code isn't using callbacks in a way that can be converted to async/await because the language and tooling don't support it.

So, after considering all this, I conclude that it's not possible to convert the given CMake code to use async/await because CMake doesn't support asynchronous operations in its build scripts. The build process is designed to be sequential, and each step must complete before the next begins, relying on dependencies rather than async/await for concurrency.

This is a CMake configuration file, which is not a programming language and does not use callbacks or support async/await. The file is used to configure the build process for a Flutter project and cannot be converted to use async/await patterns. 

CMake is a build system that handles build configuration and dependency resolution, it's not meant to be used with async/await constructs. The code you've shown is standard CMake syntax for setting up build targets and configurations.
