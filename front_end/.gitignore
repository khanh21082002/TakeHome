Alright, so I'm trying to help the user convert their callback-based code to use async/await. But wait, the user didn't actually provide any code. They just gave me a list of files and directories, probably from a .gitignore file. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Maybe they intended to share some code but forgot. I should let them know that I can't proceed without seeing the actual code. I'll ask them to provide the code they want to convert. Once they do that, I can assess whether it's possible to switch it to async/await. If it's feasible, I'll go ahead and update the code accordingly. If not, I'll explain why and offer alternative solutions. I should keep my response friendly and helpful to encourage them to provide the necessary information.

Please provide the code you'd like to convert to async/await, and I'll help you update it.
