Alright, so the user provided an XML file and asked to convert callback-based code to async/await. But the XML doesn't have any code in it. Hmm, maybe the user intended to include some JavaScript or Node.js code but forgot. Since the XML is just a workspace definition without any actual logic, there's nothing to convert. I should let them know that the provided XML doesn't contain the necessary code and ask for the specific functions they want to update. That way, I can help them effectively once they provide the relevant code.

The provided XML does not contain any callback-based code that can be converted to async/await. If you provide the actual code you'd like to convert, I can help you update it to use async/await syntax.
