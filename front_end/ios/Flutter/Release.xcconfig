Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided a code snippet that includes "Generated.xcconfig" and wants me to simplify any overly complex logic while keeping the behavior the same. 

First, I notice that the inclusion of "Generated.xcconfig" is straightforward. Xcconfig files are used in Xcode for build configurations, so including one is a common practice. The user's code seems minimal, just including this file, so there's not much to simplify here.

I should consider if there's any complex logic in the inclusion or surrounding code. Since the snippet is just an include statement, it's already as simple as it gets. Maybe the user is looking for a confirmation that this is the correct way to include the file or if there's a more efficient method.

I should also think about whether there are alternative ways to include the xcconfig file, but in this case, the #include directive is the standard approach. So, there's no need for changes because the existing code is already optimal.

Perhaps the user is dealing with a larger project where multiple xcconfig files are included, and they're looking to streamline that process. But with the given information, I can't assume that. I'll stick to the provided code and confirm that it's already simplified.

In conclusion, the code doesn't require any simplification as it's already in its simplest form. I'll let the user know that no changes are needed because the inclusion is straightforward and optimal.

There's nothing to simplify in the provided code. Including a generated xcconfig file is already as simple and optimal as it can be. The code is minimal and serves its purpose without any unnecessary complexity.

If you have more context or additional code around this include, feel free to share and I can help simplify that.
